# gui-dlp

This is a GUI front-end application for yt-dlp. You must already 
have yt-dlp (and its dependencies, such as ffmepg) installed and in 
the system PATH Environment. (Settings > System > About > Advanced 
System Settings > Advanced tab > Environment Variables > Double-
click "Path" under System Variables > make a new path to the folder 
where you placed yt-dlp (and do the same for ffmpeg, if you haven't 
already after downloading yt-dlp)).

This presently does not have all of the features available in the 
terminal, so I wouldn't recommend using it if you need more 
technically specific options.

Only supported on Windows at the moment. 
You can run it as a python script just fine, or if you want to 
convert this into an executable, I would recommend the tool 
auto-py-to-exe. (https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/).

Python-based GUI for yt-dlp. Windows only.

This is by no means "clean" code, and I am by no means an expert, 
so don't expect this to be highly optimized. 
To quote some guy, "I have no idea what I'm doing."
