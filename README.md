# gui-dlp

This is a GUI front-end application for yt-dlp. You must already 
have yt-dlp (and its dependencies, such as ffmepg) installed and in 
the system PATH Environment. (Settings > System > About > Advanced 
System Settings > Advanced tab > Environment Variables > Double-
click "Path" under System Variables > make a new path to the folder 
where you placed yt-dlp (and do the same for ffmpeg, if you haven't 
already after downloading yt-dlp)).

This presently does not have all of the features available in the 
terminal, so I wouldn't recommend using it if you need more 
technically specific options.

You can run it as a python script just fine, or if you want to 
convert this into a Windows executable, I would recommend the tool 
auto-py-to-exe (https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/), or just
use one of my releases.

It is designed with Windows in mind (Linux and macOS not thoroughly 
tested). For experimental Linux users, you may have to install "Tk"
(Tkinter module for Python) before running the python3 script, and 
pyperclip for additional functionality. A couple of features may not 
work exactly as intended in Linux (terminal window not showing with 
download progress), but core functionality may still be intact. Not 
thoroughly tested, however, so beware of bugs.
