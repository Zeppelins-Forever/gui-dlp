# gui-dlp
Python-based GUI for yt-dlp. Windows only.

This is by no means "clean" code, and I am by no means an expert, 
so don't expect this to be highly optimized. 
To quote some guy, "I have no idea what I'm doing." 

------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a GUI front-end application for yt-dlp. You must already 
have it (and its dependencies, such as ffmepg) installed and in 
the system PATH Environment.

This presently does not have all of the features available in the 
terminal, so I wouldn't recommend using it if you need more 
technically specific option.

Only supported on Windows at the moment.
